# AllerGuard

AllerGuard aims to help solve the physical and emotional distress for people with food allergies. As someone with food allergies myself, we often have to adapt and be vigilant about whether the food we eat could contain any allergens, especially hidden ones. Cross-contamination of foods is one such example of the risks that we have to be aware of. Current apps only provide features like barcode scanning for ingredients, but AllerGuard personalizes the experience. By tailoring the features to the user's allergens, it can provide personalized recipes, nearby restaurants, cross-contamination risks, and an allergen summary page to allow those with food allergies to live their lives safer and more stress-free.
